# How-Circle-
A program I made my senior year of high school for Multivariable Calculus. It takes in a picture of a hand-drawn circle and evaluates it on a scale of 0-100 of how closely it resembles a perfect circle. Uses fx, fxx, fy and fyy to do so.

To run the program, place the picture you want to evaluate in the "images" folder. Then proceed to the "classes" folder and open "picture.java". Scroll to line 824 and insert the name of the picture you want to evaluate in the "images" folder. Run the program! 

The program will find the center, fx, fxx, fy, fyy and average radius of the attempted circle. It will also draw a perfect circle based on the center found and the average radius found. Finally it will evaluate the inserted picture on a scale of 1-100 and print it out in the "interactions" section.
